# Food Data Browser

A modern web application for browsing and searching food product data, built with React and the Open Food Facts API.

## Problem Solving Approach

### 1. Understanding Requirements
- Analyzed the core requirements for food product browsing and search
- Identified key features needed: search, filtering, product details, and barcode scanning
- Determined the need for real-time updates and responsive design

### 2. Architecture Design
- Chose React for component-based architecture
- Implemented React Query for efficient data management
- Designed a modular structure for components and pages
- Planned state management strategy using Context and URL parameters

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- **Search Functionality**
  - Implemented debounced search to optimize API calls
  - Added URL synchronization for shareable searches
  - Created clear search functionality with proper state management
  - Ensured search results update in real-time

- **Product Display**
  - Designed responsive grid layout for product cards
  - Implemented detailed product view with nutrition information
  - Added image handling with fallback support
  - Created blurred background effect for product images

- **Barcode Scanner**
  - Implemented real-time barcode detection
  - Added example barcodes for testing
  - Created error handling and user feedback
  - Designed side-by-side layout for preview and examples

### 4. Testing and Optimization
- Performed component testing for search functionality
- Optimized performance with lazy loading and debouncing
- Ensured responsive design across devices
- Implemented error boundaries for graceful error handling

### 5. Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Search state persistence and clearing
  - **Solution**: Implemented URL-based state management using `useLocation` and `useSearchParams`
  - **Solution**: Created `handleClearSearch` function that:
    - Resets search term state
    - Updates URL to remove search parameters
    - Prevents URL from overriding cleared state
    - Maintains synchronization between input and URL
  - **Solution**: Added debounced search to prevent excessive API calls
  - **Solution**: Implemented proper state cleanup on component unmount

- **Challenge**: Image loading and optimization
  - **Solution**: Added fallback images with `onError` handlers
  - **Solution**: Implemented blurred background effect using:
    - Separate background image container
    - `blur-xl` and `scale-110` classes for zoom effect
    - Semi-transparent overlay for depth
    - Proper aspect ratio maintenance
  - **Solution**: Created responsive image containers with:
    - `object-contain` for proper scaling
    - `aspect-square` for consistent dimensions
    - Centered positioning with flexbox
    - Proper error state handling

- **Challenge**: Real-time barcode scanning
  - **Solution**: Created side-by-side layout using:
    - Grid layout for larger screens
    - Stack layout for mobile
    - Consistent gradient backgrounds
    - Proper spacing and padding
  - **Solution**: Added example barcodes with:
    - Vertical stack layout
    - Full-width buttons
    - Clear visual hierarchy
    - Responsive design
  - **Solution**: Implemented error handling with:
    - Clear error messages
    - Visual feedback
    - Proper state management
    - User-friendly instructions

- **Challenge**: State Management and Performance
  - **Solution**: Implemented React Query for:
    - Efficient data fetching
    - Automatic caching
    - Background updates
    - Error handling
  - **Solution**: Used Context API for:
    - Theme management
    - Global state sharing
    - Performance optimization
    - Clean component structure
  - **Solution**: Added proper cleanup with:
    - useEffect cleanup functions
    - State reset on unmount
    - Memory leak prevention
    - Resource optimization
